ELM327-emulator
===============

A python emulator for the ELM327 OBD-II adapter.

The emulator provides a virtual serial communication port to client applications (via [pseudoterminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoterminal) function), and simulates an [ELM327](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELM327) adapter connected to a vehicle through [OBD-II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-board_diagnostics) protocol.

It also allows testing [python-OBD](https://github.com/brendanwhitfield/python-OBD).

This emulator by default reproduces the message flow generated by a Toyota Auris Hybrid car, including custom messages (`scenario car`) and can be easily configured to statically and dynamically update its dictionary for other vehicles.

# Installation

```shell
# Checking python version (should be 3.7 or higher)
python3.7 -V

# Installing prerequisites
python3.7 -m pip install pyyaml
python3.7 -m pip install hexdump
python3.7 -m pip install obd # this is needed for obd_dictionary.py

# Downloading ELM327-emulator
git clone https://github.com/ircama/ELM327-emulator.git
cd ELM327-emulator
```

# Usage

Run with:

```shell
python3.7 -m elm
```

After starting the program, the emulator is ready to use. To enable the preconfigured set of PIDs of a Toyota Auris Hybrid car, issue `scenario car`.

# Compatibility

Tested with Python 3.6 and 3.7. Python 2 is not supported.

This code needs pseudo-terminal handling (pty support, `import pty`) which is platform dependent and runs with UNIX OSs. With Windows, [cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/) is supported.


# Description

The serial port to be used by the application interfacing the emulator is displayed when starting the program. E.g.:

    ELM327-emulator is running on /dev/pts/0

A [dictionary](https://docs.python.org/3.7/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries) is used to define commands and PIDs. The dictionary includes more sections (named scenarios):

- `'AT'`: set of default AT commands
- `'default'`: set of default PIDs
- `'car'`: PIDs of a Toyota Auris Hybrid veichle
- any additional custom section can be used to define specific scenarios

Default settings include both the 'AT' and the 'default' scenarios.

The dictionary used to parse each ELM command is dynamically built as a union of three defined scenarios in the following order: 'default', 'AT', custom scenario (when applied). Each subsequent scenario redefines commands of the previous scenarios. In principle, 'AT scenario is added to 'default' and, if a custom scenario is used, this is also added on top, and all equal keys are replaced. Then the Priority key defines the precedence to match elements.

If a custom scenario is selected through the *scenario* command, any key defined in the custom scenario replaces the default settings ('AT' and 'default' scenarios).

The key used in the dictionary consists of a unique identifier for each PID. Allowed values for each key (PID):

- `'Request'`: received data; a [regular expression](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) can be used
- `'Descr'`: string describing the PID
- `'Exec'`: command to be executed
- `'Log'`: *logging.debug* argument
- `'ResponseFooter'`: run a function and returns a footer to the response (a [lambda function](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#lambda) can be used)
- `'ResponseHeader'`: run a function and returns a header to the response (a [lambda function](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#lambda) can be used)
- `'Response'`: returned data; can be a string or a list/tuple of strings; if more strings are included, the emulator randomly select one of them each time
- `'Action'`: can be set to 'skip' in order to skip the processing of the PID
- `'Header'`: if set, process the command only if the corresponding header matches
- `'Priority'=number`: when set, the key has higher priority than the default (highest number = 1, lowest = 10 = default)

The emulator provides a monitoring front-end, supporting commands. The monitoring front-end controls the backend thread executing the actual process.

At the prompt `CMD> `, the emulator accepts the following commands:

- `help` = List available commands (or detailed help with "help cmd").
- `quit` (or end-of-file/Control-D, or break/Control-C) = quit the program
- `counters` = print the number of each executed PID (upper case names), the values associated to some 'AT' PIDs (*cmd_...*), the unknown requests, the emulator response delay, the total number of executed commands (*commands*) and the current scenario (*scenario*). The related dictionary is `emulator.counters`.
- `pause` = pause the execution. (Related attribute is `emulator.threadState = THREAD.PAUSED`.)
- `prompt` = toggle prompt off/on
- `resume` = resume the execution after pausing; prints the used device. (Related attribute is `emulator.threadState = THREAD.ACTIVE`)
- `delay <n>` = delay each emulator response of `<n>` seconds (floating point number; default is 0.5 seconds)
- `wait <n>` = delay the execution of the next command of `<n>` seconds (floating point number; default is 10 seconds)
- `engineoff` = switch to *engineoff* scenario
- `scenario <scenario>` = switch to `<scenario>` scenario; if the scenario is missing or invalid, defaults to `'car'`. The autocompletion (by pressing TAB) allows prompting all compatible scenarios defined in `emulator.ObdMessage`. (Related attribute is `emulator.scenario`.)
- `default` = reset to *default* scenario
- `reset` = reset the emulator (counters and variables)
- `color` = toggle usage of colors off/on
- `merge <module>` = import a scenario from an external module and merges it with the emulator configuration. `<module>` shall be a python file including the `ObdMessage` dictionary (e.g., generated by *obd_dictionary.py*) without *.py* extension (notice that the physical file shall be in the current directory and shall end with *.py*). The autocompletion allows prompting all compatible files in the current directory (type *merge*, then press space, then press TAB). After a successful merge, the new scenario can be activated through the *scenario* command.
- any other Python command can be used to query/configure the backend thread

At the command prompt, cursors and [keyboard shortcuts](https://ss64.com/bash/syntax-keyboard.html) are allowed. Autocompletion (via TAB key) is active for all previously described commands and also allows Python keywords, built-ins, self and globals.

The command prompt also allows configuring the `emulator.answer` dictionary, which has the goal to redefine answers for specific PIDs (`'Pid': '...'`). Its syntax is:

```python
emulator.answer = { 'pid' : 'answer', 'pid' : 'answer', ... }
```

Example:

```python
emulator.answer = { 'SPEED': 'NO DATA\r', 'RPM': 'NO DATA\r' }
```

The above example forces SPEED and RPM PIDs to always return "NO DATA".

To reset the *emulator.answer* string to its default value:

```python
emulator.answer = {}
```

The dictionary can be used to build a workflow. The front-end can also be controlled by an external piped automator.

Example of automation which suspends the emulator for 10 seconds:

```python
emulator.threadState = THREAD.PAUSED; time.sleep(10); emulator.threadState = THREAD.ACTIVE
```

Example of an automation that simulates the off/on ignition states:

```python
CMD> for i in range(10): emulator.scenario="car" if i % 2 else "engineoff"; print(emulator.scenario); time.sleep(10)
engineoff
car
engineoff
car
engineoff
car
engineoff
car
engineoff
car
```

Logging is controlled through `elm.yaml` file (in the current directory by default). Its path can be set through the *ELM_LOG_CFG* environment variable.

The logging level can be dynamically changed by referencing `emulator.logger`. For instance, if the logging configuration has *stdout* as the first handler (default settings of the provided `elm.yaml` file), the following commands will change the logging level:

```python
emulator.logger.handlers[0].setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
emulator.logger.handlers[0].setLevel(logging.INFO)
emulator.logger.handlers[0].setLevel(logging.WARNING)
emulator.logger.handlers[0].setLevel(logging.ERROR)
emulator.logger.handlers[0].setLevel(logging.CRITICAL)
```

It is possible to add marks in the log file via commands like `emulator.logger.info("my mark")`

Command to count the number of different PIDs (OBD Commands) used by the client (excluding AT Commands):
```python
import re
from functools import reduce
reduce(lambda x, key: x + (1 if re.match('^[A-Z]', key) and not key.startswith('AT_') and emulator.counters[key] > 0 else 0), emulator.counters, 0)
```

The following command returns the total number of OBD Commands (PID queries issued by the client excluding AT Commands):
```python
import re
from functools import reduce
reduce(lambda x, key: x + (emulator.counters[key] if re.match('^[A-Z]', key) and not key.startswith('AT_') else 0), emulator.counters, 0)
```

To only count AT Commands:
```python
from functools import reduce
reduce(lambda x, key: x + (emulator.counters[key] if key.startswith('AT_') else 0), emulator.counters, 0)
```

To save a CSV file including the *emulator.counters* dictionary:
```python
with open('mycounters.txt', 'w') as f: f.write('\r\n'.join([x + ', ' + repr(emulator.counters[x]) for x in emulator.counters]))
```

## ObdMessage Dictionary Generator for "ELM327-emulator" (obd_dictionary) ##

*obd_dictionary* is a dictionary generator for "ELM327-emulator".

It queries the vehicle via python-OBD for all available command and is also able to process custom PIDs described in [Torque CSV files](https://torque-bhp.com/wiki/PIDs).

Its output is a python *ObdMessage* dictionary that can be added to the *elm.py* program of *ELM327-emulator*, so that the emulator will be able to provide the same commands returned by the car.

Notice that querying the vehicle might be invasive and some commands can change the car configuration (enabling or disabling belts alarm, enabling or disabling reverse beeps, clearing diagnostic codes, controlling fans, etc.). In order to prevent dangerous PIDs to be used for building the dictionary, a PID blacklist can be edited in elm.py. To check all PIDs without performing actual OBDII queries, use the `-p 0` option (the standard error output with default logging level shows the list of produced PIDs).

```
usage: obd_dictionary.py [-h] -i DEVICE [-c [CSV_FILE]] [-o [FILE]] [-v] [-V]
                         [-p PROBES] [-d DELAY] [-D DELAY_COMMANDS]
                         [-n CAR_NAME] [-b] [-m]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i DEVICE             serial port connected to the ELM327 adapter (required
                        argument)
  -c [CSV_FILE], --csv [CSV_FILE]
                        input csv file including custom PIDs (Torque CSV
                        Format: https://torque-bhp.com/wiki/PIDs) '-' reads
                        data from the standard input
  -o [FILE], --out [FILE]
                        output dictionary file generated after processing
                        input data (replaced if existing). Default is to print
                        data to the standard output
  -v, --verbosity       print process information
  -V, --verbosity_debug
                        print debug information
  -p PROBES, --probes PROBES
                        number of probes (each probe includes querying all
                        PIDs to the OBDII adapter)
  -d DELAY, --delay DELAY
                        delay (in seconds) between probes
  -D DELAY_COMMANDS, --delay_commands DELAY_COMMANDS
                        delay (in seconds) between each PID query within all
                        probes
  -n CAR_NAME, --name CAR_NAME
                        name of the car (dictionary label; default is "car")
  -b, --blacklist       include blacklisted PIDs within probes
  -m, --missing         add in-line comment to dictionary for PIDs with
                        missing response
```

Sample usage: `obd_dictionary.py -i /dev/ttyUSB0 -c car.csv -o ObdMessage.py -v -p 10 -d 1 -n mycar`

The file produced by *obd_dictionary.py* can be dynamically imported in *ELM327-emulator* through the `merge` command, which loads an *ObdMessage* dictionary and merges it with *emulator.ObdMessage*. Example:

```python
# Create AurisOutput.py
python3 obd_dictionary.py -i /dev/ttyUSB0 -c auris.csv -o AurisOutput.py -n Auris
python3 -m elm # run ELM327-emulator
merge AurisOutput
scenario Auris
```

To help configuring the emulator, autocompletion is allowed (by pressing TAB) when prompting the `merge` command, including the `merge` argument. Also variables and keywords like `scenario` accept autocompletion, including the `scenario` argument.

A merged scenario can be removed via `del emulator.ObdMessage['<name of the scenario to be removed>']`.
